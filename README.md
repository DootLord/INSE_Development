# INSE_Development
Location for INSE Development UoP 2nd Year 16/17.

Built from the ground up to test my knowledge of web development and as such no client side libarys where used during development.

A Nodejs driven dashboard service allowing users to view the latest news and keep track of their tweeter feeds whilst also keeping track of key day to day with todo lists. Features a photo gallery too to allow family pictures to be seen by all house users.
